## Basic HTML server to view web pages

Depending on the version of python you are using, you can host the files locally using one of the following commands from within the `/pages` directory:

**Python 2:** `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

**Python 3:** `python3 -m http.server 8080`

Once the server is running, the site can be accessed by going to (http://localhost:8080)[http://localhost:8080] in your web browser.
